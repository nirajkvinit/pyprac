Obtaining numbers from a text file in which they are separated by spaces is a
bit trickier. One method proceeds by reading lines in a for loop, as before. But
each line now can contain several integers separated by spaces. You can use the
string method split to obtain a list of the strings representing these integers,
and then process each string in this list with another for loop.
The next code segment modifies the previous one to handle integers sepa-
rated by spaces and/or newlines.

There are several ways to read data from an input file. The simplest way is to
use the file method read to input the entire contents of the file as a single
string. If the file contains multiple lines of text, the newline characters will be
embedded in this string. The next session shows how to use the method read :

You open a file for input in a manner similar to opening a file for output. The
only thing that changes is the mode string, which, in the case of opening a file for
input, is 'r' . However, if the pathname is not accessible from the current work-
ing directory, Python raises an error. Here is the code for opening myfile.txt
for input:
